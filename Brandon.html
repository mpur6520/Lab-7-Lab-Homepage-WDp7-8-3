       <p>Brandon Goico here. I'm a student at Thomas Edison High School in the tenth grade. When I'm bored or just for pleasure, I enjoy playing video games. I like clothes and sneakers. I'm a basketball player and I travel with four different teams. I'd want to participate in the Duke basketball program. I received a basketball D3 offer. Basketball has been a part of my life since I was six years old. I enjoy learning new computer skills and website design techniques. I adore discovering new stuff.</p><font size=4px>
