      <p style="color: purple;"> Overall, I began my journey throughout web development back in 4th grade, when I had touched HTML for the first time; I didn't do anything seriously, but rather I played around with inspecting <br> the elements of websites and taking note of how they did that. I casually pursued coding, not fully devoting myself to it but also learning it at the same time, <br> where at the time I soon joined a coding summer camp--I'd say I owe most of my knowledge to my previous endeavors, and I'm looking forward to learning more about it and understanding more about <br> web development. </p>
