      <p style="color: darkcyan; font-size:"> Our goal as a Web Design team is to be able to master how exactly to make websites. <br> We would like to get better at coding as a unit, as well as being able to figure out bugs and viable solutions as to how to fix them. <br> It would be in one of our best interests to become better coders and understand more about HTML coding in itself, <br> as well as how exactly to structure our page in order to make it more visually appealing; <br> we hope to become better at this as a coding team and unit by helping each other out with any problems that may arise, whether it be through bugs <br> or not knowing how to do something. </p>
